simple-reports v2.0.0
=====================
This is a simple reort server using nodejs, twitter bootstrap, highchart, yaml, and MySQL. The bootstrap and highchart are fetched via public CDNs.  

The idea was, given a data set via SQL query, to create a decent looking report with graph and table. 

Dependencies:
* mysql
* nodejs

To install, run the following:
	$ npm install

To start application, run the following command:
	$ node server

To get demo data, load into mysql the demo data SQL file:
	reports.demo_data.sql
